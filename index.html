            <p>Hi! My name is David, I am 19 years old, and I'm currently enrolled in Applied Computer Science at <a href="https://www.dal.ca/" onclick="return confirm('Clicking this link will bring you to an external website.');">Dalhousie University</a>. I like every single genre of music, from pretty much every single era (1940-present),</p>
            <p>and my favourite song is,"I Think We're Alone Now" - 1987 by: Tiffany</p>
            <p>Listen to it here:</p>

                My favorite breed of dog is the Siberian Husky, which is why I am proud to have one as a pet (as shown in the image below).

        <h2>Field Overview</h2>
        <p>
            a hardware engineer is responsible for designing, developing, and testing the physical components of computer systems and other electronic devices.<br>
            This may include computer chips, circuit boards, systems for cooling and power management, and other components.<br>
            The goal of a hardware engineer is to create products that are efficient, reliable, and capable of meeting the needs of consumers and businesses.<br>
            This requires a strong understanding of electrical engineering principles, as well as the ability to work with a wide range of tools and technologies.<br>
            Hardware engineers often collaborate with software engineers to ensure that the hardware and software components of a device work together seamlessly.
